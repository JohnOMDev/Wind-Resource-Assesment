Data Description as it was found in https://www.kaggle.com/berkerisen/wind-turbine-scada-dataset

Context

In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

Content The data's in the file are:

1) Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals) 2) LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment 3) Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation) 4) TheoreticalPowerCurve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer 5)Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)
